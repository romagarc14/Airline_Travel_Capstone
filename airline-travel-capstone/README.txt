------------------------------------------------

SCENARIO
A client is looking to migrate their analogue flight information system to digital. The client partners with 5 major airlines to enable service to travelers nationwide. There are 6 to 12 hubs nationwide and not all airlines go to all hubs. 

On a daily basis there are, on average, 30 flights across all airports and utilize a mixture of all airports and airlines. Each flight varies in price based on distance or hub. Assume that each stop along the way adds 45 minutes to the total travel time but reduces price. 

------------------------------------------------

SPECIFICATIONS
In the flight information system, the client should be able to do the following:
 Add new airlines and associate what airports it serves
 Delete airlines
 Add new flights and associate which airline the flights are with, as well as the destination and departure airport
 Delete flights
 Retrieve all flight information
 Retrieve all Airport Hub information
 Retrieve all Airline information
 Calculate flight prices based on distance
 The cheapest or shortest flight between two airports
 Retrieve all flight information associated with a specific airline at a   specific airport

------------------------------------------------

ACTUAL ROUTES
CRUD Operations for each individual class
 In Airlines
  - Create airline
  - Update or Delete airline by Id
  - Retrieve all airlines, retrieve by Id, and retrieve by Name
 In Airports
  - Create airport (linked to airlines)
  - Update or Delete airport by Id
  - Retrieve all airports, retrieve by Id, retrieve by Name, retrieve by City, and retrieve by Airline Id
 In Flights 
  - Create flight (linked to airlines)
  - Update or Delete flight by Id
  - Retrieve all flights, retrieve by Id, retrieve all flights by airline Id, retrieve all flights by Price*, retrieve all flights by Minutes Traveled**, retrieve all by Destination, retrieve flights by Airport and Airline, retrieve flights by Airport and Destination***

*Price is calculated by Distance, Minutes Traveled, and Airline Rate. Price is sorted by ascending order, showing the least expensive flight first.
**Minutes Traveled is sorted by ascending order, showing the lowest number of minutes first.
***Flights retrieved by Airport and Destination can be sorted by minutes traveled or by price. These options show the cheapest or shortest flights between airports.

Price Calculation:
	a = airline rate coefficient
	d = distance
	t = time
	c = conversion (50)

	price = (a * d * c) / t
